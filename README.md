### This project was done in part to satisfy the requirements for the course Deep Learning(CS4240) at TU Delft.
### We were tasked with reproducing the results of the paper “Exploring the Security Boundary of Data Reconstruction
via Neuron Exclusivity Analysis”. In this blog we’ll be elaborating on our efforts to reproduce the results, the issues we faced and the discussion about the possibility of reproducing the paper.
